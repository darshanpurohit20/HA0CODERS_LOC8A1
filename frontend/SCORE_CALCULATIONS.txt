HOW SCORES ARE CALCULATED — EASY EXPLANATION
=============================================
(For the SwipeCard on the Approve Leads page)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
WHERE DOES THE DATA COME FROM?
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
All scores are fetched FROM MongoDB at runtime.
Nothing is hardcoded. They are NOT stored separately —
they are CALCULATED in the frontend (ApproveLeads.tsx)
every time the page loads using the raw MongoDB fields.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1. VECTOR SCORE (shown in blue)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
MongoDB Field Used: Intent_Score

Formula:
  Vector Score = Intent_Score × 100

Example for BUY_33049:
  Intent_Score in MongoDB = 0.92
  Vector Score shown = 0.92 × 100 = 92.0

Why? Intent_Score in MongoDB is stored as a 0–1 value.
We multiply by 100 to show it as a percentage-style score.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
2. INTENT SCORE (shown in purple)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
MongoDB Field Used: Intent_Score (same field as above)

Formula:
  Intent Score = Intent_Score × 100

Example:
  Intent_Score = 0.92 → shows 92.0

Note: Currently Vector Score and Intent Score use the
same MongoDB field (Intent_Score). You can separate
them later if you add a different vector/embedding score
from your ML pipeline.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
3. MOMENTUM (shown in orange)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
MongoDB Field Used: Response_Probability

Formula:
  Momentum = Response_Probability × 100

Example for BUY_33049:
  Response_Probability in MongoDB = 0.68
  Momentum shown = 0.68 × 100 = 68.0

Why Response_Probability? It measures how likely the
buyer is to respond to outreach — basically the
"momentum" of engagement. Higher = more likely to act.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
4. MATCH % (the ring at top-right of card)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
MongoDB Fields Used: Intent_Score + Response_Probability

Formula:
  Match % = ((Intent_Score + Response_Probability) / 2) × 100

Example for BUY_33049:
  Intent_Score       = 0.92
  Response_Probability = 0.68
  Average            = (0.92 + 0.68) / 2 = 0.80
  Match %            = 0.80 × 100 = 80%

In plain English:
  "We take how interested the buyer is (Intent)
   and how likely they are to respond (Response),
   average them, and show that as a match percentage."

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
IS THE 80% STORED OR CALCULATED?
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
CALCULATED at runtime — it is NOT stored in MongoDB.

Every time the Approve Leads page loads:
  Step 1: Frontend calls /leads API → gets raw MongoDB docs
  Step 2: For each lead, frontend JS calculates the scores
  Step 3: Card renders with those computed values

The MongoDB only stores the raw fields:
  Intent_Score, Response_Probability, Prompt_Response,
  Revenue_Size_USD, Team_Size, etc.

The frontend does the math on the fly.

QUICK REFERENCE TABLE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Card Field         MongoDB Field            Formula
──────────         ─────────────            ───────
Vector Score   →   Intent_Score         ×  100
Intent Score   →   Intent_Score         ×  100
Momentum       →   Response_Probability ×  100
Match %        →   avg(Intent + Response)  × 100
Team Size      →   Team_Size               (raw)
Revenue        →   Revenue_Size_USD        /1M → $XM
Priority Sigs  →   Tariff_News, Funding_Event,
                   DecisionMaker_Change,
                   Engagement_Spike, etc.  (binary flags)
