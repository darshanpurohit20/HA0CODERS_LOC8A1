## 🎬 Demo Script - 3 Minutes

### Opening (15 seconds)
"Hi, we're [Team Name], and we built TIPE - the Trade Intent Prediction Engine. What if B2B matchmaking was as easy as Tinder?"

### Problem (20 seconds)
"Exporters waste 15+ hours per week reviewing spreadsheets of potential buyers. Traditional B2B platforms are slow, manual, and don't understand intent."

### Solution (30 seconds)
"TIPE uses AI to rank leads using three factors: vector similarity for product fit, intent scoring for buying signals, and trade momentum analysis. Then we made it dead simple - just swipe."

### Live Demo (90 seconds)
1. **Dashboard** (10s): "Here's the command center with real-time KPIs"
2. **Swipe Interface** (50s): ⭐ FOCUS HERE
   - "Watch this - swipe right to approve..."
   - [Demonstrate smooth swipe]
   - "Left to reject..."
   - [Show card flying off]
   - "Up to skip..."
   - [Show instant next card]
   - "Notice the AI explains WHY each match works"
   - "Trust verified with blockchain"
3. **Quick Tour** (20s):
   - "AI handles conversations"
   - "Schedules meetings automatically"
   - "Even generates LinkedIn content"
4. **Analytics** (10s): "Deep insights into what's working"

### Close (30 seconds)
