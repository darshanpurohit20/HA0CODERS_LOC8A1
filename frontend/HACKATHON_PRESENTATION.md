## 🏅 Judge Questions - Prepared Answers

### Technical Questions

**Q: How does the vector similarity work?**
A: "We embed company attributes (products, markets, size, etc.) into high-dimensional vectors. Similar companies cluster together. We measure cosine similarity to find matches. The backend would use models like sentence-transformers or OpenAI embeddings."

**Q: What about scalability?**
A: "We built this with production in mind:
- React + TypeScript for type safety
- Zustand for lightweight state management
- TanStack Query for server state
- Lazy loading and code splitting
- Ready to handle thousands of leads"

**Q: How do you handle real-time updates?**
A: "Currently optimistic updates on client. For production:
- WebSocket connection for live data
- Server-sent events for notifications
- Redis for caching ranked leads
- Background jobs for re-ranking"

### Business Questions

**Q: Who is this for?**
A: "Export managers, trade facilitators, and B2B marketplaces. Anyone matching buyers and sellers across borders. Initial target: Mid-size manufacturers expanding internationally."

**Q: What's the competitive advantage?**
A: "Three things:
1. First swipe interface for B2B - makes it consumer-grade simple
2. Multi-factor AI ranking - not just keyword matching
3. Full automation - from discovery to conversation to content"

**Q: How would you monetize?**
A: "Freemium SaaS model:
- Free: 10 swipes/month
- Pro: $99/mo - Unlimited swipes + AI conversations
- Enterprise: Custom - White-label + API access + Custom models"

**Q: What's next?**
A: "Three priorities:
1. Mobile app with offline mode
2. Integration with major CRMs (Salesforce, HubSpot)
3. Advanced ML models trained on successful deal patterns"

### UX Questions

**Q: Why swipe for B2B?**
A: "Decision fatigue is real. Exporters review hundreds of leads. Swipe gestures are:
- Fast: 10x quicker than forms
- Intuitive: Everyone knows Tinder
- Fun: Makes tedious work engaging
- Data-rich: We track hesitation, speed, patterns"

**Q: What about false positives?**
A: "Our skip function (swipe up) lets you defer decisions. Also:
- AI explains reasoning for transparency
- Trust verification reduces risk
- You can review approved leads before outreach
- Learn from user feedback to improve ranking"
